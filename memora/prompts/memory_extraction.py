- Ignore insignificant details that you are very certain will be unhelpful in future personalized responses.
- Never fabricate any detail not present or strongly implied in the interaction.

- Keep each memory descriptive, self-contained, not exceed 25 words.  
- Use proper tense (past, present, continuous) as appropriate.  
- Always use #user_#id# instead of ({user_name}) and #agent_#id# instead of ({agent_label}) in the memories. 
- Output must be JSON format using the schema:
